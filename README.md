# About the Code
In this repository you will find mini speech command folder in which there is our dataset. It consists of 8 speech commands: up,down,left,right,go,stop,yes,no. There is Avirup_Swarup folder in which there is our codes in .ipynb extension format. The main code is Speech_command_classification.ipynb. We have used here a 13 layer CNN,the hyperparameters of which has been optimized using Genetic Algorithm Neural Architecture Search(GA-NAS).
